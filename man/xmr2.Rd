\title{Generate the XMR data for any time-series data.}
\usage{
xmr2(df, measure, interval, recalc, reuse, testing, longrun, shortrun)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{The dataframe containing the time-series data. 
Must be in tidy format.
At least 1 variable for time and one variable for measure.}

\item{measure}{The column containing the measure. Must be in numeric format.}

\item{interval}{The interval you'd like to use to calculate the averages. 
Defaults to 5.}

\item{recalc}{Logical: if you'd like it to recalculate bounds. Defaults to False}

\item{reuse}{Logical: Should points be re-used in calculations? Defaults to False}

\item{testing}{Logical to print test results}

\item{longrun}{Used to determine rules for long run. First point is the 'n' of points used to recalculate with, and the second is to determine what qualifies as a long run. Default is c(5,8) which uses the first 5 points of a run of 8 to recalculate the bounds. If a single value is used, then that value is used twice i.e. c(6,6))}

\item{shortrun}{Used to determine rules for a short run. The first point is the minimum number of points within the set to qualify a shortrun, and the second is the length of a possible set. Default is c(3,4) which states that 3 of 4 points need to pass the test to be used in a calculation. If a single value is used, then that value is used twice i.e. c(3,3))}

Will be used to calculate XMR data.
